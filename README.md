**Web Asset Scanner and Vulnerability Analyzer**

This script is designed to automate the process of identifying subdomains, discovering web assets associated with a given domain, and performing vulnerability scanning on these web assets. The identified information is stored in a MongoDB database for further analysis.


**Prerequisites**

MongoDB installed and running on localhost:27017.

Required Node.js modules installed. You can install them using the following command:

npm install mongodb request async colors

External tools installed:

subfinder: Used for subdomain enumeration.

httpx: Used for web asset discovery.

nuclei: Used for vulnerability scanning.


**Setup**

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url> cd <repository_directory>

Install Node.js dependencies:

npm install mongodb request async colors readline

Ensure that the required external tools (subfinder, httpx, nuclei) are installed and accessible from your command line.


**Usage**

Run the script:

node script.js

Follow the prompts to enter the domain name.


**Workflow**

The script uses subfinder to enumerate subdomains and saves the results to a file (subdomains.txt).

It then employs httpx to discover web assets from the subdomains list and stores the results in the MongoDB database.

The script initiates a vulnerability scan using nuclei on the discovered web assets.

Vulnerability details are stored in the vulnerability_details collection in the MongoDB database.


**Notes**

Ensure that MongoDB is running before executing the script.

Make sure to configure the MongoDB connection details in the script if your MongoDB instance is not running on the default localhost:27017.

Adjust the external tool paths in the script if they are not in your system's PATH.

The script utilizes the colors library for console output formatting.


**Disclaimer**

This script is provided as-is, and usage may vary based on specific environments and requirements. Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards when scanning web assets. Use this script responsibly and with proper authorization.
