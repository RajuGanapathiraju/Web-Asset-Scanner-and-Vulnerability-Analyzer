# Automated Web Asset Scanner and Vulnerability Analyzer

This script automates the process of identifying subdomains, discovering web assets, and performing vulnerability scanning on these assets. The results are stored in a MongoDB database for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- MongoDB installed and running on `localhost:27017`.


## External tools installed:

subfinder: Used for subdomain enumeration.

httpx: Used for web asset discovery.

nuclei: Used for vulnerability scanning.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 'git clone 'https://github.com/RajuGanapathiraju/Web-Asset-Scanner-and-Vulnerability-Analyzer.git''
cd 'Web-Asset-Scanner-and-Vulnerability-Analyzer'
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install mongodb request async colors readline dotenv
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
node with_mongo.js
```

2. Follow the prompt to enter the domain name

## Workflow

1. The script uses subfinder to enumerate subdomains and saves the results to a file (subdomains.txt).
2. It employs httpx to discover web assets from the subdomains list and stores the results in the MongoDB database.
3. The script initiates a vulnerability scan using nuclei on the discovered web assets.
4. Vulnerability details are stored in the vulnerability_details collection in the MongoDB database.
5. Will generate the html report with finding details as a output.


## Notes

1. Keep the external tools (subfinder, httpx, nuclei) updated for compatibility.
2. MongoDB should be running before executing the script. Configure MongoDB connection details in the script if not using the default localhost:27017.
3. Adjust the external tool paths in the script if not in your system's PATH.
4. Ensure that MongoDB is running before executing the script.
5. The script utilizes the colors library for console output formatting.

This script is provided as-is. Usage may vary based on environments and requirements. Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards when scanning web assets. Use this script responsibly and with proper authorization.
